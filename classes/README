About:
======
This directory contains some general c++ classes
(and fortran code?) mainly used for molecular simulation.

Documentation:
==============
Ideally all code should be commented using the Doxygen
comment format so that a html (or pdf) manual can be
automatically created by issuing the command:

$ doxygen (Requires doxygen AND graphviz)

Example programs can be put in the "examples" dir and
referenced to using the \example keyword. Graphics can
be put in the "images" catalog.
