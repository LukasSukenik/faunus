About:
======
This directory contains some general c++ classes
(and fortran code?) mainly used for molecular simulation.

Documentation:
==============
Ideally all code should be commented using the Doxygen
comment format so that a html (or pdf) manual can be
automatically created by issuing the command:

$ make doc (Requires doxygen AND graphviz)

Example programs can be put in the "examples" dir and
referenced to using the \example keyword. Graphics can
be put in the "images" catalog.


Before committing changes:
==========================
Try to make sure that no classes nor examples are broken before
committing changes to the repository. Check with

$ make classes
$ make examples (not yet implemented)
