About:
======
This directory contains some general c++ classes
(and fortran code?) mainly used for molecular simulation.

Documentation:
==============
Ideally all code should be commented using the Doxygen
comment format so that a html manual will be created by
issuing the command:

$ doxygen

Example programs can be put in the "examples" dir and
preferably linked to using the \example keyword.
