WELCOME TO FAUNUS:
  Faunus is a C++ class library for creating programs
  for Monte Carlo simulation of molecular systems.

CITING FAUNUS:
  Lund, M., Persson, B., Trulsson, M. (2008) Source Code Biol. Med. 3:1
  http://www.scfbm.org/content/3/1/1 (free full text)

REQUIREMENTS:
  1. C++ compiler (gnu, ibm, intel, sun etc.)
  + cmake (for cross platform compilation)
  + Gromacs (for xtc trajectory output)
  + Doxygen (for code manual)
  + Graphviz (for code manual)

  (+ optional)

COMPILING:
  $ make
  $ make manual (requires doxygen)

  Edit the Makefile to:
  - Specify the C++ compiler.
  - Enable Gromacs compressed trajectory output (.xtc).
  - Enable OpenMP parallization. 

  Experimental support for multicore parallization is supported
  through OpenMP. Most modern C++ compilers support OpenMP
  directives including gnu, intel, ibm, portland etc. Edit the
  makefile to enable this feature. At runtime one may specify
  the number of processors to use via OMP_NUM_THREADS. For
  small systems it may be faster to turn off parallization.

COMPILING USING CMAKE (Experimental):
  Faunus and all dependencies can by automatically configured
  using a menu-based interface. Here one may switch on/off options,
  select the compiler, installation directories etc. With time
  this will be the default method of compilation.
  $ ccmake .
  $ make

  Alternatively, use the command line:
  $ cmake . [options]
  $ make

  Options:
    -DOPENMP=on|off     Enable OpenMP support
    -DGROMACS=on|off    Enable Gromacs XTC file support

  Environmental variables:
    CXX - C++ compiler command (icpc, pathCC, pgCC etc.)

DIRECTORY LAYOUT:
  classes      Mostly finished, general classes.
  examples     Example programs
  legacy       Older programs. FORTRAN programs are also placed here.
  lib          The faunus library (static)
  undone       Unfinished code
  misc         Mostly temporary stuff
  doc          Code manual files
  xcode        Apple Xcode project (redundant due to cmake Xcode target)
