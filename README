REQUIREMENTS:
  * A unix-type environment (MacOS X, Linux etc.)
  * C++ compiler (gnu, ibm, intel etc.)
  * Gromacs (optional, for xtc trajectory output)
  * Doxygen (optional, for code manual)
  * Graphviz (optional, for code manual)

COMPILING:
  * make
  * make manual (requires doxygen)

  Edit the Makefile to:
  - Specify the C++ compiler.
  - Enable Gromacs compressed trajectory output (.xtc).
  - Enable experimental OpenMP support.

  classes      Mostly finished, general classes.
  examples     Example programs
  legacy       Older, working programs
  undone       Unfinished code
  misc         Mostly temporary stuff.
