WELCOME TO FAUNUS:
  Faunus is a C++ class library for creating programs
  for Monte Carlo simulation of molecular systems.

CITING FAUNUS:
  Lund, M., Persson, B., Trulsson, M. (2008) Source Code Biol. Med. 3:1
  http://www.scfbm.org/content/3/1/1 (free full text)

REQUIREMENTS:
  - C++ compiler (gnu, intel, sun, pgi, ibm)
  - cmake 2.6
  Optional:
  - Boost python (for python module)
  - OpenBabel 2 (numerous molecular formats)
  - Doxygen and Graphviz (for code manual)
  - Xcode (for neat environment on macos x)

  Developed and tested on Linux, MacOS X.

COMPILING:
  Menu based setup:
  $ ccmake .
  $ make [help]

  Text based setup:
  $ cmake . [options]

  Options:
    -DENABLE_OPENMP=on|off   Enable OpenMP support
    -DENABLE_PYTHON=on|off   Enable python support
    -DENABLE_FORTRAN=on|off  Compile legacy fortran programs
    -DENABLE_BABEL=on|off    Use OpenBabel for file I/O

  Example for Intel's C++ compiler with OpenMP parallization:
    $ CXX=icpc cmake . -DENABLE_OPENMP=on
    $ make

  Run test suite:
    $ make test (or use 'ctest -V' for verbose output)

PYTHON SUPPORT:
  Classes from Faunus can be accessed via Python, provided that
  the python module is compiled (requires boost python). Build with:

  $ make python-generate
  $ make python

  Include misc/python in PYTHONPATH and access Faunus
  via "import faunus".

  Non-system python frameworks (MacOS) may be specified the first time
  cmake is run. For example for MacPorts:

  $ LDFLAGS=-F/opt/local/Library/Frameworks cmake .

  Alternatively, force the dynamic linker to favor a specific framework
  directory before starting python. For example:

  $ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6
  $ python

DIRECTORY LAYOUT:
  src          Sourcecode and examples
  include      Header files
  legacy       Older programs. FORTRAN programs are also placed here.
  undone       Unfinished code
  misc         Miscellaneous
  doc          Code documentation (auto generated)
