  BIOMOLECULAR MONTE CARLO ROUTINES 
=====================================

Introduction:
=============
Currently this package contains two MC programs
for protein simulations:

* pka  - Protonation properties of a single protein
         in a salt solution.
* prot - Protein-protein interaction in a salt solution
         including charge regulation. Also, flexible
         titrating polyelectrolytes can be added (un-documented)
* pka_chain - Protonation properties of a single protein
         in a salt solution

The documentation is very limited and you may resort
to the scripts in the "prot-prot" and "pka" directories.

Requirements:
=============
* C++ compiler (tested with g++, icc, xlC)
* Some shell, like BASH.
* Python (for converting PDB files to "AAM" format)
* scientificpython module (-//-)


Compilation and installation:
=============================
The programs are written in standard C++ using the
GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) available on most unix
systems, including MacOS X, linux, bsd etc. Simply
edit the Makefile to match your system and type the
following (generic is default):

$ cd src
$ make
$ make doc (if you want source code documentation)

This will create the binary files in the src directory
where they should stay put since this is where the
script (.sh) files in the "prot-prot" and "pka" directories
will look for them.


Source Code Documentation:
==========================
I have recently started documenting the source code using
doxygen. However, only a fraction of the classes are included
so far. They are found in src/html after you have envoked
'make doc' (Requires a full doxygen installation).

The pKa program:
================
This program will calculate the protonation status of a single
molecule in a salt solution. When the program starts it will
deprotonate all titrateable sites, which will typicall render
the (protein) molecule charged. In order to maintain electro-
neutrality, you will need to add counter ions in addition to
possible salt particles. In the shell scripts, this is typically
specified by nion_init. Next, the simulation will begin and you
should first run a short equilibration run, followed by a more
elaborate run where you improve the statistics. This is automa-
tically handled in the shell scripts.
