Python crash on MacOSX
----------------------
When importing the faunus module, python may crash.
If this happens if probably means that faunus.so is
linked against another python framework than boost
python. Check with:

$ otool -L faunus.so
$ otool -L path_to_boost_library/libboost_python-mt.dylib

Fix this by forcing the dynamic linker to search the
framework directory used by boost python before
starting your python session:

$ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=dir_with_python_library_to_use
$ python
