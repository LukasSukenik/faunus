DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLES:

Implicit solvent:
------------------
titrate
  Proton titration of a single macromolecule in an explicit salt
  envirinment. Protons are moved in and out of the protein to
  sample the average protonation state, pka values and dipole
  moment as well as charge fluctuations.
  
widom
  Ion activity coefficients by particle insertion. An "ghost" ion pair is
  randomly inserted in a salt solution.

manybody
  Many arbitrary rigid bodies in a continuum solvent - cubic box

isobaric
  Many rigid bodies in a Debye-Huckel solution. NPT ensemble.

twobody
  Two macro-molecules in a continuum solvent - cell model. The macromolecules
  are allowed to symmetrically move along the z-axis and rotate around their
  mass centers. Calculates the potential of mean force and includes charge
  and dipole fluctuations.

twobody-hof
  ...as above + an empirical pot. between ions and hydrophobic groups.
